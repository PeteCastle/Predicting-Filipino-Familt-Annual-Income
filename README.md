### Introduction
Every 3 years, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) conducts a nationwide research of family income and expenditure including material consumption.  It also includes demographic information and housing characteristics.  The data collected is used to analyze socioeconomic status of the Filipino people and determine how these factors contribute to existing problems in our society.

### Dataset
The dataset is obtained in this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure).  The data is based from the 2015 Family Income Expenditure Survey by the Philippine Statistics Authority.  With the table size of 41544 rows and 60 columns, it contains features/columns about the family's income, region, expenditures, educational attainment, material belongings, and many more.  For full list of columns, see the code below.  

### The Problem
These following are the reasons why I chose this project:
1. There is a need to incorporate machine learning in analyzing the socioeconomic status of our country.
1. There is an existing gap in determining the annual income of a family based from factors such as demographics, expenses, and material belongings.
1. A standard on what a family should possess based from its annual income is lacking.


### Objectives
The following are the expected outcome of this project:
1. Determine how select factors contribute to the annual income of a family.
1. Clean the data to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
1. Develop a supervised machine learning model to predict the annual income of a family based on socio-economic factors.

### Results
The main caveat in this model is that it has less accuracy on annual income brackets that have less data (that is, of higher socioeconomic status)

Nevertheless, With a score of 86.13% using Ridge Regression, we can now predict the annual income of a household just by determining their socieconomic livelihood and status.

That ends my machine learning analysis.  Thank you!
